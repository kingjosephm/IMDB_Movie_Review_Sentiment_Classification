Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.</td>\n",

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n",

    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a family of simple, supervised learning algorithms that use Bayes' theorem combined with a strong \"naive\" assumption of conditional independence between features given the value of the outcome variable. Although this assumption is frequently violated in many real-world applications, naive Bayes algorithms often work well as classifiers (e.g. especially in document classification and spam filtering), though they tend to be poor estimators. An explanation for this paradox can be found [here](https://www.cs.unb.ca/~hzhang/publications/FLAIRS04ZhangH.pdf); essentially, the answer lies in the distribution of dependence within a class often cancelling each other out. Compared to more sophisticiated classifiers, naive Bayes classifiers are extremely fast and scalable. \\[[3](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html)\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This naive Bayes classifier model is based on a \"bag of words\" (BOW) approach, which converts text (words or word combinations) into numerical representation for analysis. The BOW approach, however, only focuses on the number of times a given word appears in a document, not the order of words (as compared to more sophisticiated context-dependent algorithms like BERT). Specifically, I use sklearn's `CountVectorizer`, which counts the number of tokens present  per document among all tokens in the corpus. By default, `CountVectorizer` removes punctuation and changes words lowercase; I also remove non-alphanumeric characters with NLTK's regex tokenizer and English stopwords. Code and inspiration for this method were drawn in part from [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-introduction-to-naive-bayes-algorithm-96831d77ac91).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there is per-se no default algorithm for sklearn's Naive Bayes API, I began by comparing model performance across algorithms. I also experiment with two other hyperparameter n-gram, and vectorizer."

    "## Word Embeddings, GloVe, and LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are dense, distributed real-value vector representations of words, which are often tens or hundreds of dimensions. Each dimension can be thought of as an abstract feature that captures semantic, contextual, and syntactic meanings of words based on their learned usage.<sup>\\[[4](https://medium.com/@b.terryjack/nlp-everything-about-word-embeddings-9ea21f51ccfe)\\]</sup> These dense vector representations contrast with a sparse one-hot vector representations of words (e.g. `CountVectorizer`), which are not only a computationally inefficient way to represent data, but unable to capture the similarity of words as they represent words as independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most popular word embeddings algorithms are [Word2Vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-word-embedding-and-word2vec-652d0c2060fa) and [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), which are both unsupervised learning approaches. Originally proposed by Thomas Mikolov and colleagues at Google in 2013,<sup>\\[[5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf)\\]</sup> Word2Vec is built upon a shallow, two-layer feed-forward neural network that relies on one of two architectures: *continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)* or *continuous skip-gram*. Whereas CBOW approach models the target (middle) word given the surrounding context words, skip-gram models the context words given the current word in a sentence. Both approaches require specification of the *context window*, or the number of adjacent words (typically 5-10), to infer the similarity of words. Proposed in 2014 by [Stanford researchers](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf), GloVe offers a different word embedding approach using matrix factorization. Unlike Word2Vec, which infers word meaning based only on local contextual information of words, GloVe relies on both local and *global* word context by aggregating word-word co-occurrence for a corpus (see [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-ml-intuitive-guide-to-understanding-glove-embeddings-b13b4f19c010) for a more in-depth explanation). The authors of GloVe argue their approach allows this method to better differentiate the specific meaning of words among related words<sup>\\[[6](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove//)\\]</sup> (though not to the degree of understanding contextual and multiple word meanings as with [contextual word embeddings like ELMo](https://towardsdatascience.com/elmo-contextual-language-embedding-335de2268604) or [transformer-based architectures like BERT](https://towardsdatascience.com/bert-explained-state-of-the-art-language-model-for-nlp-f8b21a9b6270)). In practice, however, both algorithms often perform similarly for many tasks, while the particular dataset and number of embedding dimensions tends to have a larger impact on performance.<sup>\\[[7](https://machinelearninginterview.com/topics/natural-language-processing/what-is-the-difference-between-word2vec-and-glove/)\\]</sup> \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most promising ideas in NLP is *transfer learning*. Though this can refer to a variety of techniques,<sup>\\[[8](https://ruder.io/state-of-transfer-learning-in-nlp/)\\]</sup> this typically refers to training a supervised model in one task in one domain and applying that trained model to a related task or domain.<sup>\\[[9](https://ruder.io/transfer-learning/)\\]</sup> This approach not only vastly speeds up training time, but also reduces problems associated with modeling an inadequately-sized sample or a sample with insufficient variation. Rather than train an embedding model using the comparably-small IMDB Movie Review dataset, I use pretrained GloVe embeddings available from the [Stanford GloVe Project's website](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). Several versions are available; I use the 2014 Wikipedia edition containing 6 billion tokens and 400k unique words. There are 50d, 100d, 200d, and 300d vectors available for this dataset. I use the 300d variant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors cannot be directly used to classify sentiment (or any other modeled outcome). Generally, researchers use these vector representations as an input to a stand-alone supervised learning model. In particular, because text data contain temporal dependencies between words in the same document, [recurrent neural network (RNN)](https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-networks-d4642c9bc7ce) are best suited to this task. Although it is possible to capture time dependencies with tree-based and feedforward neural networks with properly-engineered features, RNNs share information from upstream inputs via a *hidden state*, providing that information to downstream inputs. I use a variant of RNN called [long short-term memory [LSTM]](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), which are specifically designed to learn long-term dependencies. The core idea of LSTMs is the *cell state*, which acts as the hidden state allowing and allows information to potentially flow through unchanged. Information is added or removed from the cell state by a series of *gates* (e.g. an \"input gate\", \"output gate\", and \"forget gate\"). For brevity, I only use a LSTM model, though it's best to compare performance with another RNN, the [gated recurrent unit [GRU]](https://medium.com/mindboard/lstm-vs-gru-experimental-comparison-955820c21e8b)."
